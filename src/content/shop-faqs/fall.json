      "question": "How long do fall press-on nails last?",
      "answer": "Our fall press-on nails typically last 7-14 days with proper application using nail glue. With adhesive tabs, expect 2-3 days of wear. For maximum longevity, ensure your natural nails are clean, dry, and lightly buffed before applying. Avoid prolonged water exposure in the first 2 hours after application, and your autumn-themed nails will stay beautiful throughout the season.",

This makes them incredibly cost-effective – you can rock those gorgeous maple leaf designs for multiple fall gatherings.",

      "question": "Do press-on nails damage natural nails?",
      "answer": "No! When applied and removed correctly, press-on nails are actually gentler than gel or acrylic. The key is using proper removal technique: soak in warm soapy water for 10-15 minutes, then gently lift from the sides. Never force or peel them off. Our fall collection includes detailed application and removal instructions to keep your natural nails healthy all season long.",

      "question": "How do I choose the right size press-on nails?",
      "answer": "Each set includes 24-30 nails in multiple sizes to fit all nail beds perfectly. Simply match each press-on to your natural nail width – it should cover your nail completely without touching the skin. If between sizes, choose the slightly larger one and file down for a custom fit. Our fall collection's variety ensures every finger gets that perfect autumn look.",

      "question": "What's the best way to apply fall press-on nails?",
      "answer": "For long-lasting fall nails: 1) Prep natural nails (push back cuticles, buff surface lightly), 2) Clean with alcohol wipe, 3) Apply thin layer of glue to both surfaces, 4) Press firmly for 30 seconds, 5) Avoid water for 2 hours. For temporary wear, use the included adhesive tabs. Our fall designs look salon-quality when applied correctly – perfect for Thanksgiving, fall weddings, or everyday autumn style.",

      "question": "Can I switch between different fall designs?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! That's the beauty of press-ons. Start with pumpkin spice designs for early fall, switch to maple leaves for mid-autumn, then go with deep burgundy for late season. If using adhesive tabs, you can change your look every few days. With glue application, safely remove after 1-2 weeks and try a new fall design. Mix and match to match your mood and occasions throughout the entire season.",
