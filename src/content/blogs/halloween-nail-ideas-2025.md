faqItems:
  - question: "How do you do Halloween nails at home for beginners"
    answer: "Start with easy designs like ghost French tips or simple pumpkin dots. Use a thin nail art brush for details, white polish for ghost shapes on nude base, and black dots for eyes. Always apply base coat first to prevent staining from dark colors. Top coat seals your design and adds shine."
  - question: "What are the trending Halloween nail colors for 2025"
    answer: "Chrome finishes dominate 2025 with deep purple, matte black, and blood red leading trends. Jewel tones like emerald green and sapphire blue are replacing traditional orange. Metallics in gold and copper paired with gothic burgundy create sophisticated spooky looks that work beyond October 31st."
  - question: "Can you do Halloween nail art on short nails"
    answer: "Absolutely. Short nails work perfectly for minimalist ghost designs, thin black French tips, subtle spiderweb accents on feature nails, and solid matte colors. Focus on one or two accent nails rather than detailed art on every finger for maximum impact on shorter nail beds."
  - question: "How long do Halloween gel nails last"
    answer: "Gel Halloween nails typically last two to three weeks with proper application and care. Use quality base coat, cap free edges with each layer, avoid hot water for 24 hours after application, and apply cuticle oil daily. 3D designs may require extra top coat layers for durability."
  - question: "What Halloween nail designs are work appropriate"
    answer: "Opt for subtle designs like deep burgundy with gold accents, matte black with single chrome nail, nude base with delicate spiderweb on ring finger, or oxblood red solid color. Negative space designs featuring small bats or moons against bare nails create refined Halloween vibes for professional settings."
  - question: "How to remove dark Halloween nail polish without staining"
    answer: "Always use proper base coat before applying black, red, or orange polish. For removal, soak cotton pad in acetone, press onto nail for 30 seconds, then gently wipe. Never scrub aggressively. Follow with cuticle oil to nourish nails. Peel-off base coat works great under glitter designs."
  - question: "What are 3D Halloween nails and how are they done"
    answer: "3D Halloween nails feature raised elements like sculpted pumpkins, textured spider webs, or dimensional bats created with builder gel or acrylic. Apply design elements on cured base color, cure again, then seal with thick top coat. These dramatic designs photograph beautifully but may not suit active lifestyles."
  - question: "Best Halloween nail ideas for almond shaped nails"
    answer: "Almond nails suit elongated designs like dripping blood effects, vertical spiderweb patterns, ombre fades from black to red, and coffin-inspired black tips with metallic chrome highlights for a dramatic yet elegant spooky vibe."

## Tips for Long-Lasting Halloween Nails

**Choose Gel or Dip**: Lasts 2-3 weeks without chipping for multi-day festivities.

**Prep Is Everything**: Clean, buffed nails with quality base coat prevent staining from dark polishes.

**Thin Coats Win**: Multiple thin coats dry faster and last longer than one thick coat.

**Seal Those Tips**: Wrap tips with topcoat by swiping over nail edge to prevent peeling.

**Cuticle Oil Daily**: Keeps nails hydrated. Dry cuticles cause polish to lift.
