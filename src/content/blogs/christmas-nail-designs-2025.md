faqItems:
  - question: 'How long do Christmas nail designs last?'
    answer: 'Gel Christmas designs last 2-3 weeks with proper care, while regular polish lasts 5-7 days. Gel lasts longer because it is cured under UV light, creating a harder finish that resists chipping. Pro tip: Apply cuticle oil daily to extend wear time and prevent lifting at the edges.'
  - question: 'When should I get my Christmas nails done?'
    answer: 'Book your Christmas nail appointment 3-5 days before the holiday for gel or acrylics. This timing ensures the nails fully cure and look fresh on Christmas Day. Avoid booking the week before Christmas as salons get completely booked during this peak season.'
  - question: 'What are the trending Christmas nail colors for 2025?'
    answer: 'The top Christmas nail colors for 2025 include classic crimson red, emerald green, icy silver chrome, and glazed donut finishes. Unexpected trends include burgundy wine tones and blush pink with gold accents. Metallic finishes and holographic topcoats are dominating this season.'
  - question: 'Can I do Christmas nail designs at home?'
    answer: 'Yes, you can create stunning Christmas nails at home with the right tools and practice. Start with simple designs like accent nails, glitter gradients, or nail stickers. Invest in quality gel polish, a UV lamp, dotting tools, and striping tape for professional-looking results at a fraction of salon costs.'
  - question: 'What nail shape works best for Christmas designs?'
    answer: 'Almond and coffin shapes provide the most canvas for intricate Christmas nail art and elongate fingers beautifully. Short square or rounded nails work perfectly for simpler festive designs and are more practical for holiday cooking and gift wrapping. Choose based on your lifestyle and design complexity.'
  - question: 'How do I make Christmas nails last through New Year?'
    answer: 'Use gel polish instead of regular lacquer for maximum longevity through the holidays. Apply cuticle oil twice daily, wear gloves when washing dishes or cleaning, and avoid using nails as tools. Get a fill or touch-up appointment between Christmas and New Year for extended wear.'
  - question: 'Are Christmas nails appropriate for work?'
    answer: 'Opt for subtle Christmas nails for professional settings with neutral bases and minimal festive accents like a single red accent nail or delicate gold foil. Save bold designs with 3D embellishments and full holiday scenes for personal time. Many workplaces allow festive nails during December as seasonal spirit.'
  - question: 'What is the best base coat for Christmas nail art?'
    answer: 'Use a high-quality gel base coat like Gelish Foundation or OPI Nail Envy for long-lasting Christmas designs. A strong base prevents staining from dark polishes and provides better adhesion for intricate art. For regular polish, a ridge-filling base creates a smooth canvas for detailed work.'
  - question: 'How much do Christmas nails cost at a salon?'
    answer: 'Basic Christmas gel manicures cost forty to sixty dollars, while elaborate designs with hand-painted art run seventy to one hundred twenty dollars. Acrylic sets with festive embellishments range from sixty to one hundred fifty dollars. DIY costs are significantly lower at fifteen to thirty dollars for supplies.'
  - question: 'What tools do I need for Christmas nail art?'
    answer: 'Essential tools include a quality gel polish set, UV or LED lamp, dotting tools in multiple sizes, striping tape, fine detail brushes, and nail art stickers. Add a cuticle pusher, nail file, and top coat for professional results. These tools allow you to recreate salon-quality Christmas designs at home.'
  - question: 'How do I remove Christmas nail designs safely?'
    answer: 'Soak gel Christmas nails in acetone for ten to fifteen minutes using cotton pads and foil wraps to break down the polish. Gently push off softened gel with a cuticle pusher without forcing or scraping. Apply cuticle oil and hand cream immediately after removal to restore moisture and prevent damage.'
  - question: 'Can I wear Christmas nails if I have short nails?'
    answer: 'Short nails are perfect for Christmas designs with simplified patterns like single accent nails, glitter tips, or small festive decals. Focus on bold solid colors like classic red or emerald green with minimal embellishments. Short nails actually make holiday tasks like gift wrapping and cooking much easier.'

okay but like... Christmas nails are literally my FAVORITE thing to do every year. There's something about transforming plain nails into tiny festive masterpieces that just hits different during the holidays. And 2025? Girl, the trends this year are *chef's kiss*.

I've been doing holiday nails since 2019, and let me tell you—the evolution from basic red polish to the glazed chrome Christmas nails we're seeing now is INSANE. This year, I'm seeing requests for designs I never even imagined five years ago. Classic reds and greens are still going strong (thank god, because they're timeless), but we're also seeing unexpected colors like icy silver, burgundy wine tones, and even blush pink with gold accents dominating the <a href='https://www.mirelleinspo.com/topics/seasonal-trends' class='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline'>seasonal trends</a>.

In this guide, I'm breaking down 50+ Christmas nail designs for 2025—from elegant and minimalist to full-on festive chaos. Whether you're hitting up holiday parties in LA, cozying up for a winter wedding, or just want your nails to match your Christmas sweater, I've got you covered. Plus, I'll share the exact techniques I use in my Culver City studio, product recommendations that won't break the bank, and honest tips for making your Christmas nails last through New Year's Eve.

## What's Trending in Christmas Nails for 2025

> **Quick Answer:** The biggest Christmas nail trends for 2025 include glazed donut chrome finishes, candy cane French tips, minimalist snowflake accents, and burgundy wine tones mixed with classic reds. Holographic topcoats and 3D embellishments are everywhere this season.

ngl, this year's Christmas nail trends are making me emotional. We're seeing such a beautiful blend of nostalgic classics and modern innovation. The <a href='https://www.mirelleinspo.com/topics/nail-art-guides' class='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline'>nail art community</a> has absolutely outdone itself.

**Glazed Donut Christmas Nails** are EVERYWHERE right now. Think Hailey Bieber's signature glazed look but make it festive—icy chrome bases with subtle shimmer that catches the light like fresh snow. I'm obsessed. I've been mixing chrome powders with traditional Christmas colors and the results are stunning.

**Candy Cane French Tips** are having a major moment. Instead of the classic white tip, we're doing red and white diagonal stripes that mimic actual candy canes. It's playful, it's festive, and honestly? It's easier to execute than you'd think. I did these on a bride last week for her winter wedding and she literally cried (happy tears, obviously).

**Minimalist Snowflake Accents** are perfect for anyone who wants festive but subtle. We're talking one or two accent nails with delicate hand-painted snowflakes on a nude or soft pink base. It's elegant enough for corporate holiday parties but still screams "I'm festive and I know it."

**Burgundy and Wine Tones** are the unexpected MVP this season. Deep, moody reds mixed with gold foil accents give major luxury vibes. It's less "Santa Claus" and more "expensive winter cabin in Aspen." I'm here for it.

The color palette this year is RICH. We're seeing classic crimson reds, emerald greens, icy silvers, champagne golds, and those gorgeous deep burgundies I mentioned. Metallic finishes and holographic topcoats are absolutely dominating—everyone wants that extra sparkle for holiday photos.

## Classic Christmas Nail Designs That Never Go Out of Style

> **Quick Answer:** Timeless Christmas nail designs include solid red or green gel polish, French tips with festive twists, and simple gold accent nails. These classic looks work for any age, nail length, or skill level and remain popular year after year.

Let's talk about the classics, because honestly? Sometimes you just need a reliable red manicure that looks expensive and lasts. I've been doing nails for six years and I can confidently say that classic Christmas designs will NEVER die.

**Solid Red Gel Polish** is the little black dress of Christmas nails. It's elegant, it's timeless, and it goes with literally everything. My go-to is <a href='https://www.mirelleinspo.com/shop/christmas' class='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline'>Gelish "A Kiss in the Dark"</a>—it's a true blue-based red that makes your hands look expensive. Apply two thin coats over a quality base, cure properly, and seal with a glossy top coat. Done. Gorgeous. No notes.

**Emerald Green Manicures** are criminally underrated. If you're tired of red (which, valid), a deep jewel-tone green is SO festive without being obvious. I love pairing emerald green with a single gold accent nail on the ring finger. It's subtle but still very "I put thought into this."

**French Tips with a Holiday Twist** are my bread and butter during December. Classic nude base with a white tip is beautiful, but swapping that white for red, green, or even glitter? *Chef's kiss*. I've been doing red tips with tiny gold dots along the smile line and my clients are OBSESSED.

**Gold Accent Nails** are the easiest way to elevate any Christmas look. Paint all your nails in a festive color (red, green, white, burgundy—literally anything), then do your ring finger in gold glitter or foil. It's a five-minute upgrade that makes people think you spent hours on your nails.

The beauty of these classic designs is that they work on ANY nail length. Short nails? Stunning. Long stilettos? Gorgeous. Almond shape? Perfect. You literally cannot go wrong.

## Trendy Christmas Nail Art Ideas for 2025

Here's where we get FUN, bestie. If classic nails are the foundation, nail art is where we build the mansion. These are the designs my clients are requesting like crazy this season.

**Snowflake Nail Art** is having a MOMENT. I'm seeing everything from delicate hand-painted flakes to chunky 3D snowflakes with rhinestone centers. My technique: Use a fine detail brush with white gel polish on a light blue or silver base. Paint three crossing lines, then add smaller lines between them. Boom—snowflake. Cure it, seal it, and you're done. Takes maybe 3 minutes per nail once you get the hang of it.

**Reindeer and Santa Designs** are cute but can go wrong SO fast if you're not careful. My rule: ONE accent nail max with a character design. Paint Rudolph on your ring finger over a neutral base, keep the rest of your nails simple with coordinating colors. Trust me on this—I learned the hard way after doing full-set Santa faces that looked more horror movie than holiday cheer.

**Plaid and Tartan Patterns** are PERFECT for anyone who loves that cozy cabin aesthetic. Use striping tape to create clean lines—horizontal and vertical stripes in red, green, and white over a nude base. Remove the tape before curing and seal with top coat. It looks WAY harder than it actually is.

**Ombre Christmas Gradients** are beautiful and surprisingly easy. Use a makeup sponge to blend red into white for a candy cane effect, or green into gold for an elegant look. The key is working quickly before the polish dries on your sponge. I go through like 10 makeup sponges a day during December (RIP to my supply budget).

**3D Embellishments** are for the BOLD. We're talking rhinestones, tiny bows, metallic studs, and even miniature ornaments. Apply them while your top coat is still tacky, then seal with another thin layer. Fair warning: these babies will catch on EVERYTHING. Sweaters, hair, your boyfriend's shirt—you've been warned.

Is your vibe more "elegant AF" or "chaotic Christmas energy"? 🎄 Drop a ✨ or 🎅!

## Christmas Nails for Short Nails

okay so real talk—I used to think you needed long nails to do festive designs. I was WRONG. Some of my most stunning Christmas nails have been on short, natural nails.

Short nails are actually IDEAL for the holidays. Think about it: you're wrapping presents, cooking meals, decorating your tree—long nails would be a nightmare. Short nails are practical AND gorgeous when done right.

**Best Designs for Short Nails:**
- **Single Accent Nail Approach**: Paint four nails in classic red, make your ring finger a glittery gold or add a tiny snowflake. Simple, effective, doesn't overwhelm the nail.
- **Glitter Tips**: Instead of full glitter nails (which can look chunky on short nails), just do the tips. It's like a festive French manicure but easier.
- **Small Nail Decals**: Those tiny Christmas stickers were MADE for short nails. One little tree, one snowflake, one candy cane per nail. Adorable and takes 30 seconds.
- **Bold Solid Colors**: Sometimes the best design is no design. A gorgeous deep burgundy or emerald green on short, well-shaped nails looks SO expensive.

**Shaping Tips for Short Nails**: Keep them slightly rounded or soft square. Sharp edges on short nails can look stubby, but a gentle curve is universally flattering. File in one direction (never back and forth) to prevent splitting.

The mistake I see people make is trying to cram too much design onto a small canvas. Less is more, bestie. One well-executed element beats five messy ones every time.

## DIY Christmas Nails: Step-by-Step Tutorial

Alright, let's get into the actual HOW. This is my go-to tutorial for classic red and gold Christmas nails that look salon-quality but cost like $25 in supplies. I've taught this to probably 200 clients who wanted to learn <a href='https://www.mirelleinspo.com/topics/at-home-hacks' class='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline'>at-home techniques</a>.

**What You'll Need:**
- Quality gel polish in red (I love Beetles or Gelish)
- Gel base coat and top coat
- UV or LED lamp (I use a 48W lamp, gets the job done)
- Gold foil sheets (Amazon has these for like $8)
- Nail file, buffer, cuticle pusher
- Alcohol wipes or rubbing alcohol
- Dotting tool or toothpick
- Detail brush (optional but helpful)

**Step 1: Nail Prep (Don't Skip This!)**
File your nails to your desired shape. I'm team almond or rounded square for Christmas nails—they're flattering and practical. Push back your cuticles gently (don't cut them unless you know what you're doing). Buff the nail surface LIGHTLY—we're talking like 3-4 swipes max. You just want to remove shine, not thin your natural nail. Wipe each nail with alcohol to remove any oils. This step is CRITICAL for long-lasting gel.

**Step 2: Base Coat Application**
Apply a thin layer of gel base coat to all nails. Make sure you cap the free edge (run the brush along the tip). This prevents lifting. Cure under your UV lamp for 60 seconds. If your lamp is lower wattage, go for 90 seconds.

**Step 3: First Color Layer**
Apply your first coat of red gel polish. THIN LAYERS are the secret to perfect gel nails. A thick coat will never cure properly and will cause wrinkling. Cure for 60 seconds. Apply a second thin coat and cure again. Two thin coats > one thick coat, always.

**Step 4: Gold Foil Magic**
Here's where it gets fun. Apply a thin layer of top coat to your accent nails (I do ring fingers). While it's still tacky, use tweezers to press small pieces of gold foil onto the nail. The foil will stick to the tacky layer. You can do full coverage, random patches, or just the tips. Get creative! Once you're happy with the placement, apply another thin layer of top coat over the foil to seal it. Cure for 60 seconds.

**Step 5: Final Seal**
Apply a generous layer of gel top coat to ALL nails. Make sure you cap those free edges again. Cure for 60 seconds. Wipe off the tacky layer with an alcohol wipe. Apply cuticle oil and you're DONE.

This whole process takes about 45 minutes once you get the hang of it. The first time? Maybe an hour. But you'll have salon-quality nails that last 2-3 weeks for the cost of one coffee.

## Best Products for Christmas Nails in 2025

Let me save you from the product overwhelm because I've tried EVERYTHING. Here are the products I actually use in my studio and on my own nails.

**Gel Polish Brands:**
- <a href='https://www.mirelleinspo.com/shop/trendy' class='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline'>**Gelish**</a>: My day-one love. "A Kiss in the Dark" (red), "Holy Cow-girl!" (burgundy), and "Garden Teal Party" (emerald) are my Christmas holy trinity. Quality is consistent, lasts 3 weeks no problem. Worth the $15-18 per bottle.
- **Beetles**: Okay so I was skeptical of Amazon gel polish but Beetles DELIVERS. Their Christmas collection is like $25 for 6 colors and the quality is shockingly good. Great for experimenting with trends without breaking the bank.
- **OPI GelColor**: If you want luxury, OPI is it. "Big Apple Red" and "Romantically Involved" are stunning. Pricier at $20+ per bottle but the formula is buttery smooth.

**Tools That Changed My Life:**
- **Makartt 48W UV LED Lamp** ($30 on Amazon): This lamp cures everything perfectly in 60 seconds. I've had mine for 3 years, still works like new.
- **Twinkled T Detail Brushes** ($12 for a set): These are WORTH IT for nail art. The bristles hold their shape and the precision is unmatched.
- **Beetles Nail Drill** ($40): If you're serious about at-home nails, a drill makes prep SO much faster. I use it for cuticle work and removing old gel.

**Must-Have Accessories:**
- Gold foil sheets (Amazon, $8)
- Striping tape in gold and silver
- Dotting tools in multiple sizes
- Nail stickers/decals (Etsy has amazing Christmas ones)
- Quality nail file (glass files are gentle on natural nails)

**Base and Top Coats:**
- **Gelish Foundation Base**: Prevents staining from dark polishes and helps with adhesion
- **OPI Nail Envy**: For natural nails between gel manicures—strengthens like crazy
- **Beetles No-Wipe Top Coat**: Saves you the alcohol wipe step and has crazy shine

I've wasted SO much money on products that didn't work. These are the ones I reorder every month without fail.

## Christmas Nail Colors and Combinations

Color theory is everything in nail art, and Christmas gives us such a FUN palette to play with. Here are my favorite combos that work every single time.

**Classic Combinations:**
- **Red + Gold**: Timeless, elegant, works on everyone. Use a deep crimson red with gold foil accents or glitter tips.
- **Green + Silver**: Fresh take on traditional. Emerald green with silver chrome or shimmer is SO pretty.
- **White + Gold**: Winter wonderland vibes. Perfect for anyone who finds red/green too "Christmas-y."
- **Burgundy + Rose Gold**: Modern and sophisticated. This is my go-to for clients who want festive but grown-up.

**Unexpected Combinations That WORK:**
- **Blush Pink + Copper**: Soft and romantic with just enough festive sparkle. Perfect for winter weddings.
- **Navy + Silver**: Underrated! It's festive without screaming Christmas. Great for professional settings.
- **Plum + Gold**: Rich, moody, absolutely gorgeous. I did these on myself last Christmas and got so many compliments.
- **Icy Blue + White**: Frozen-inspired elegance. Add silver snowflakes and *chef's kiss*.

**Skin Tone Considerations:**
Listen, I believe everyone can wear any color, but certain shades are more flattering on different <a href='https://www.mirelleinspo.com/topics/skin-tones' class='text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline'>skin tones</a>:
- **Fair skin**: Blue-based reds, deep burgundies, emerald greens
- **Medium skin**: True reds, orangey-reds, gold, copper
- **Deep skin**: Berry tones, rich plums, champagne gold, white

The most important thing? Wear what makes YOU happy. Color "rules" are suggestions, not laws.

Team Red 💅 or Team Green 🎨? One emoji, be honest!

## Christmas Nails for Different Occasions

Not all Christmas nails are created equal. What works for a family dinner might be too extra for the office, and what's perfect for a holiday party might be too flashy for a church service.

**Office-Appropriate Christmas Nails:**
Keep it subtle, bestie. A single red accent nail on a nude base. Delicate gold French tips. Minimalist snowflakes on two nails max. The key is "festive when you look closely" rather than "CHRISTMAS EXPLOSION."

I have a client who's a lawyer and she still wants festive nails—we do a gorgeous burgundy with a single thin gold stripe on each ring finger. Professional but with personality.

**Holiday Party Nails:**
This is where you GO FOR IT. Full glitter? Yes. 3D embellishments? Absolutely. Candy cane stripes on every nail? Why not! Holiday parties are your excuse to be extra. I did a full set of red glitter ombre with rhinestone snowflakes for a client's company party and she sent me photos all night. She felt AMAZING.

**Family Gathering Nails:**
Classic and pretty. Solid reds or greens, maybe some gold accent nails. You want something that looks good in family photos without overshadowing your outfit. French tips with a festive twist are perfect here.

**Wedding/Formal Event Christmas Nails:**
Elegant and understated. Nude bases with delicate gold or silver accents. Soft pinks with tiny snowflakes. Deep burgundy with rose gold. Remember: your nails are in every ring photo and bouquet shot, so choose something timeless.

**At-Home/Casual Christmas Nails:**
Whatever makes you happy! This is your time to test out trends, practice techniques, or just rock some basic red polish. No judgment, no pressure.

## How to Make Your Christmas Nails Last

okay so story time: my first Christmas doing nails professionally, I had THREE clients call me panicking because their gorgeous holiday nails were lifting after like 5 days. I was STRESSED. Turns out, longevity is like 70% prep, 20% application, and 10% aftercare.

**Prep is EVERYTHING:**
Seriously, this cannot be overstated. Properly prepped nails last 3 weeks. Rushed prep lasts 5 days. Push back cuticles, buff lightly, remove ALL oils with alcohol. If your nails are naturally oily (like mine), wipe twice.

**Application Tips:**
- Thin layers only (I know I keep saying this but people STILL don't listen)
- Cap the free edge with every single layer
- Cure for the full time—don't rush it
- Avoid getting polish on your skin or cuticles (it'll peel off and take your mani with it)

**Aftercare is Crucial:**
Apply cuticle oil twice daily. Morning and night, without fail. It keeps your cuticles moisturized and prevents lifting at the edges. Wear gloves when washing dishes or cleaning. I know it's annoying, but chemicals break down gel polish. Avoid using your nails as tools (no opening cans, scratching off labels, etc).

**When to Touch Up:**
If you see lifting, DO NOT PICK AT IT. Apply a tiny drop of nail glue under the lifted area and press down. If a nail chips badly, file it smooth and apply a layer of regular polish in a similar color until you can get a proper fix.

**Making It Through New Year:**
Most Christmas nails are applied early-to-mid December. To make them last through January 1st, book a quick fill or touch-up appointment between Christmas and NYE. Just refreshing the top coat and fixing any minor chips can extend your mani another 10 days.

## Common Christmas Nail Mistakes to Avoid

Let me share the mistakes I see (and have made myself) so you don't have to learn the hard way.

**Mistake #1: Too Much Design**
More is not always more. I've seen nails with snowflakes AND reindeer AND candy canes AND ornaments all on one hand. It's chaos. Pick ONE main design element and build around it.

**Mistake #2: Skipping Base Coat**
Your red polish WILL stain your natural nails without a proper base coat. I learned this my first year doing nails and walked around with yellow-tinged nails for a month. Don't be me.

**Mistake #3: Thick Polish Layers**
Thick layers = wrinkling, peeling, and general sadness. Two thin coats > one thick coat. Always.

**Mistake #4: Not Curing Long Enough**
If your gel feels sticky or soft after curing, it's not done. Cure for the full 60 seconds, or 90 seconds if your lamp is older/lower wattage.

**Mistake #5: Ignoring Cuticle Care**
Dry, crusty cuticles ruin even the most beautiful manicure. Use cuticle oil religiously. Your nails will thank you.

**Mistake #6: Booking Too Late**
Salons are SLAMMED the two weeks before Christmas. Book your appointment in early December or be prepared to take whatever time slot they have left (spoiler: it'll be 7 AM on a Tuesday).

**Mistake #7: Removing Gel Incorrectly**
DO NOT peel off gel polish. I repeat: DO NOT. Soak it off properly with acetone, cotton, and foil. Peeling takes layers of your natural nail with it and you'll have weak, damaged nails for months.

Did I just call you out on any of these? 😅 We've all been there!

## FAQ: Everything You Need to Know About Christmas Nails

### How long do Christmas nail designs last?

Gel Christmas designs last 2-3 weeks with proper care, while regular polish lasts 5-7 days. Gel lasts longer because it is cured under UV light, creating a harder finish that resists chipping. Pro tip: Apply cuticle oil daily to extend wear time and prevent lifting at the edges.

### When should I get my Christmas nails done?

Book your Christmas nail appointment 3-5 days before the holiday for gel or acrylics. This timing ensures the nails fully cure and look fresh on Christmas Day. Avoid booking the week before Christmas as salons get completely booked during this peak season.

### What are the trending Christmas nail colors for 2025?

The top Christmas nail colors for 2025 include classic crimson red, emerald green, icy silver chrome, and glazed donut finishes. Unexpected trends include burgundy wine tones and blush pink with gold accents. Metallic finishes and holographic topcoats are dominating this season.

### Can I do Christmas nail designs at home?

Yes, you can create stunning Christmas nails at home with the right tools and practice. Start with simple designs like accent nails, glitter gradients, or nail stickers. Invest in quality gel polish, a UV lamp, dotting tools, and striping tape for professional-looking results at a fraction of salon costs.

### What nail shape works best for Christmas designs?

Almond and coffin shapes provide the most canvas for intricate Christmas nail art and elongate fingers beautifully. Short square or rounded nails work perfectly for simpler festive designs and are more practical for holiday cooking and gift wrapping. Choose based on your lifestyle and design complexity.

### How do I make Christmas nails last through New Year?

Use gel polish instead of regular lacquer for maximum longevity through the holidays. Apply cuticle oil twice daily, wear gloves when washing dishes or cleaning, and avoid using nails as tools. Get a fill or touch-up appointment between Christmas and New Year for extended wear.

### Are Christmas nails appropriate for work?

Opt for subtle Christmas nails for professional settings with neutral bases and minimal festive accents like a single red accent nail or delicate gold foil. Save bold designs with 3D embellishments and full holiday scenes for personal time. Many workplaces allow festive nails during December as seasonal spirit.

### What is the best base coat for Christmas nail art?

Use a high-quality gel base coat like Gelish Foundation or OPI Nail Envy for long-lasting Christmas designs. A strong base prevents staining from dark polishes and provides better adhesion for intricate art
