        "question": "Do fall press-on nails damage natural nails?",
        "answer": "When applied and removed correctly, press-on nails do not damage your natural nails. The key is proper removal: never peel or pull them off.

Between applications, give your natural nails some care with cuticle oil and a strengthening treatment to keep them healthy all season.",

        "question": "Do Christmas press-on nails work in cold weather?",
        "answer": "Yes! Unlike gel manicures that can crack in cold temperatures, press-on nails remain flexible and durable in winter weather. The adhesive actually bonds better in moderate temperatures. Just make sure your hands are completely dry before application, as winter moisture can affect adhesion. Once applied, your Christmas nails will withstand cold weather, indoor heating, and all your holiday activities.",

Remove your Christmas nails anytime by soaking in warm soapy water for 10 minutes. If you used quality glue, save the nails after cleaning them - they're reusable! Then apply a different design from our New Year collection for your NYE celebrations. Switch festive styles as often as you like.",
