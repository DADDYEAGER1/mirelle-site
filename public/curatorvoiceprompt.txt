**Search:**
- "Google search algorithm updates [current month] [year]"
- "Google E-E-A-T guidelines [year]"
- "ChatGPT search optimization [year]"
- "Perplexity AI crawling best practices [year]"

**Extract:**

ALGORITHM STATUS - [DATE]
═══════════════════════════════════════════

GOOGLE CORE UPDATES:

```

### Step 1B: Competitor SERP Analysis
**Search:**
- "[Primary keyword]" (analyze top 5 results)
- "[Primary keyword] 2025" (if seasonal)
- Related searches and "People Also Ask"

**For Each Top 5 Competitor:**
- URL, Domain Authority estimate
- Word count
- Content structure (H2s, images, schema)
- Strengths (what's working)

COMPETITOR #1: [Site Name]
═══════════════════════════════════════════
URL: [url]
Words: ~[count]
Structure: [summary]
Images: [count]

STRENGTHS:
✓ [4 strengths]

WEAKNESSES:
✗ [4 weaknesses]

[Repeat for top 5]

OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE:

```

### Step 1C: Keyword Research
**Search Sources:**
1. Google autocomplete for [primary keyword]
2. Google "People Also Ask"
3. Google "Related searches"
4. Google Trends (last 30 days)
5. Competitor keyword usage

**Research Requirements:**
- 40-60 candidate keywords
- Score by: Relevance (30%), Search volume (25%), User intent match (25%), Competition (20%)
- Classify: Primary (1), Secondary (10), LSI variations (15), Long-tail queries (25+)

**CRITICAL: SEARCH QUERY EXTRACTION**
Find actual user searches like:
- "how to [action]"
- "best [product] for [use case]"
- "why does [problem] happen"
- "[topic] vs [alternative]"
- "can you [action]"

**Output Format:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════

SECONDARY KEYWORDS (10):

**TONE:**

✅ **Curator voice (DO):**
> "Every top nail artist we talked to agrees: gel base coat is non-negotiable. One pro shared a story about rescuing a bride's manicure hours before her wedding—and it all came down to proper base coat application..."

❌ **Expert voice (DON'T):**
> "I use OPI Nail Envy on all my clients because it's the only strengthener that actually works."

✅ **Curator voice (DO):**
> "OPI Nail Envy consistently ranks as the #1 nail strengthener across thousands of reviews. We tested it against 5 competitors, and here's why professionals reach for it first..."

- "Want to try this? Here's how..."

Questions to reader:
- "Which design speaks to you?"

---

## PHASE 5: CONTENT GENERATION

### Pre-Generation Checklist:
- [ ] All research phases completed
- [ ] Structure approved
- [ ] Affiliate links received
- [ ] Images planned
- [ ] Voice system understood

### Generation Rules:

**KEYWORD INTEGRATION (1-1.5% Density):**

**Smart Strategy:**
1. Use primary keyword ONCE in title
2. Use primary keyword 1-2 times strategically in content (intro + one H2)
3. Use VARIATIONS everywhere else:
   - "Christmas nails" → "holiday manicure", "festive nail art", "December designs", "seasonal nails"
4. Use year (2025) ONLY in title + 1-2 strategic spots (not every mention)

**Example - WRONG (Robotic):**
> "Christmas nails 2025 are trending. The best Christmas nails 2025 include red Christmas nail designs 2025. Here are 30 Christmas nails ideas 2025 that work for Christmas parties 2025..."

**Example - RIGHT (Natural):**
> "Holiday nails just got a major upgrade. We curated 30 festive designs that work for December parties, family dinners, and New Year's Eve. From deep burgundy with gold accents to minimalist winter whites, these seasonal manicures prove you don't need cartoon Santas to celebrate. Whether you're booking a salon appointment or doing your nails at home, you'll find your perfect holiday look here..."

*Keyword appears naturally, variations used throughout*
