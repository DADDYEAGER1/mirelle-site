- "ChatGPT search optimization [year]"
- "Perplexity AI crawling best practices [year]"

**Extract:**
- Latest ranking signals
- Content format priorities
- Penalty triggers to avoid
- GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) requirements

**TREND RESEARCH - FUTURE-FOCUSED:**

**Time Horizons:**

- **Future (3-6 months):** Predictive trend analysis

**Research Sources:**
1. **Google Trends:**
   - Set date range to "Past 12 months"
   - Check "Rising" queries (not just "Top")
   - Compare seasonal patterns year-over-year

2. **Pinterest Trends:**
   - Check Pinterest Predicts (annual trend forecast)
   - Look at "Trending now" and "On the rise"
   - Pinterest leads Google by 3-6 months

3. **Social Listening:**

   - Instagram Reels trending audio
   - Reddit community discussions
   - Beauty influencer early adopters

4. **Runway/Fashion Week:**

Images: [count]

✓ [4 strengths]

WEAKNESSES:
✗ [4 weaknesses]

[Repeat for top 5]

→ [How we'll differentiate]
```

### Step 1C: Keyword Research & User Query Extraction

**Search Sources:**
1. Google autocomplete for [primary keyword]
2. Google "People Also Ask"
3. Google "Related searches"
4. Google Trends (last 30 days)
5. Competitor keyword usage
6. AnswerThePublic for question-based queries
7. Reddit/Quora actual user questions
8. Pinterest search suggestions

**Research Requirements:**
- 40-60 candidate keywords
- Score by: Relevance (30%), Search volume (25%), User intent match (25%), Competition (20%)
- Classify: Primary (1), Secondary (10), LSI variations (15), Long-tail queries (25+)

**KEYWORD COMPETITION TARGETING:**

**PRIMARY KEYWORD (What post ranks for):**
- **Competition Level:** MODERATE (50-70 competition score)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Moderate search volume (5K-50K monthly)
  - Achievable with quality content + backlinks
  - Not dominated by major brands entirely
  - Room for authority blogs to rank
- **Research Tools:** Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Keyword Planner
- **Example:** "goddess nails 2025" (moderate competition)

**SUPPORTING CLUSTER KEYWORDS (Secondary targets):**
- **Competition Level:** LOW (20-40 competition score)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Lower search volume (500-5K monthly)
  - Long-tail variations
  - Easier to rank quickly
  - Build topical authority
- **Example:** "how to do goddess nails at home" (low competition)

**PRIMARY KEYWORD DENSITY: 2.0% TARGET**

**Formula:**
- (Primary Keyword Count / Total Word Count) × 100 = 2.0%

**Example Calculation:**
- 3,500-word post → Primary keyword should appear ~70 times
- 2,000-word post → Primary keyword should appear ~40 times

**Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Title:** 1 time (natural placement)
2. **Introduction (first 100 words):** 1-2 times
3. **H2 Headings:** 4-6 times (40% of H2s)
4. **Body Content:** Remaining occurrences distributed naturally
5. **Image Alt Text:** 60% of images should include keyword
6. **FAQ Section:** 3-5 times in questions/answers

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- ✅ Use exact match primary keyword at 2.0% density
- ✅ Use LSI variations liberally (these DON'T count toward 2%)
- ✅ Natural placement > forced stuffing
- ✅ Semantic variations are unlimited

**SEMANTIC SEO & LSI KEYWORDS (Unlimited Usage):**

**LSI Keywords DO NOT count toward 2% keyword density - use freely!**

**Research Process:**
1. LSIGraph.com for semantic variations
2. Google "Related searches" at bottom of SERP
3. Competitor content analysis (what terms they use)
4. Thesaurus + industry terminology

**Example for "goddess nails":**

**Semantic Variations:**
- celestial manicure
- divine nail art
- mythological nails
- Greek-inspired nails
- heavenly nail designs
- opulent manicure
- luxurious nail art
- ethereal nails
- angelic nail designs

**Related Concepts:**
- gold leaf application
- pearl embellishments
- cat-eye shimmer
- maximalist nail trend
- nail extensions
- stiletto shape
- almond nails
- gel polish

**Usage in Content:**
- ✅ Substitute freely in body text
- ✅ Use in image captions
- ✅ Natural language variety
- ✅ Prevents repetitive writing
- ✅ Helps Google understand topic depth

**USER SEARCH INTENT QUERIES (Extract 30+ Direct User Searches):**

**Format by Intent Type:**

**Informational Queries (20+):**
- "what are [topic]"
- "how to do [action]"
- "why does [problem] happen"
- "can you [action] with [condition]"
- "are [topic] worth it"

**Commercial Queries (5+):**
- "best [product] for [use case]"
- "[product A] vs [product B]"
- "affordable [product] for [need]"

**Transactional Queries (5+):**
- "where to buy [product]"
- "[product] price"
- "[service] near me"

**CRITICAL: Use Exact Phrasing**
- Copy the EXACT question format users type
- Include grammar quirks, casual language
- These become H2 headings and FAQ questions
- Don't "clean up" or formalize the queries

**Output Format:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════

## PHASE 2: CONTENT STRATEGY & STRUCTURE

### Step 2A: Title Optimization
**Generate 5 options following:**
- 50-60 characters

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Obsessed: 30 Christmas Nails That Stop Traffic"

**Output Format:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════

1. [title] (X chars) - [why this works]
2. [title] (X chars) - [why this works]
3. [title] (X chars) - [why this works]
4. [title] (X chars) - [why this works]
5. [title] (X chars) - [why this works]

RECOMMENDED: Option [#]

SEO TITLE (<60 chars):
[optimized version]

META DESCRIPTION (150-160 chars STRICT):

```

### Step 2B: Content Structure Plan

**STRICT WORD COUNT ENFORCEMENT:**

- **Target Range:** 3,500 - 5,000 words
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive authority content that ranks for competitive keywords

- **Purpose:** Support pillar content with specific subtopics
- **Post Types:** How-To Tutorials (Type D), Comparison Posts (Type E), Trend Reports (Type C)

```

```

**Long-Tail Keyword Strategy:**

```

**Rules:**
- ✅ 5-10 gallery images per post
- ✅ Each has unique long-tail keyword in filename

✅ **Curator voice (DO):**
> "Every top nail artist we talked to agrees: gel base coat is non-negotiable. One pro shared a story about rescuing a bride's manicure hours before her wedding—and it all came down to proper base coat application..."

❌ **Expert voice (DON'T):**
> "I use OPI Nail Envy on all my clients because it's the only strengthener that actually works."

---

## PHASE 5: CONTENT GENERATION

### Pre-Generation Checklist:
- [ ] All research phases completed
- [ ] Structure approved
- [ ] Affiliate links received
- [ ] Images planned
- [ ] Voice system understood

### Generation Rules:

**KEYWORD INTEGRATION (2.0% Density):**

**Smart Strategy:**
1. Use primary keyword at 2.0% density (calculated in research phase)
2. Use VARIATIONS everywhere else:
   - "Christmas nails" → "holiday manicure", "festive nail art", "December designs", "seasonal nails"
3. Use year (2025) ONLY in title + 1-2 strategic spots (not every mention)
4. LSI keywords are UNLIMITED - use freely for natural writing

**Example - WRONG (Robotic):**
> "Christmas nails 2025 are trending. The best Christmas nails 2025 include red Christmas nail designs 2025. Here are 30 Christmas nails ideas 2025 that work for Christmas parties 2025..."

**Example - RIGHT (Natural):**
> "Holiday nails just got a major upgrade. We curated 30 festive designs that work for December parties, family dinners, and New Year's Eve. From deep burgundy with gold accents to minimalist winter whites, these seasonal manicures prove you don't need cartoon Santas to celebrate. Whether you're booking a salon appointment or doing your nails at home, you'll find your perfect holiday look here..."

*Keyword appears naturally at 2.0% density, variations used throughout*

**CONTENT STRUCTURE:**
