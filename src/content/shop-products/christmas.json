          "question": "Do these heart reindeer nails have real glitter or is it printed?",
          "answer": "The silver glitter is an integral part of the nail design, expertly applied and sealed under a protective glossy topcoat. This ensures the sparkle remains vibrant and doesn't shed or irritate your skin throughout the entire 7-14 day wear period."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are nude pink heart reindeer nails good for professional settings?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Will the silver glitter irritate my skin?",
          "answer": "No. The glitter is safely sealed under the glossy topcoat and doesn't come into contact with skin. The adhesive is dermatologically tested and safe for most skin types. However, if you have sensitive skin, test a small area first."

        {
          "question": "How do I remove these press-on nails without damage?",
          "answer": "Soak your nails in warm water with soap for 5-10 minutes to soften the adhesive, then gently lift from the edges. Avoid yanking or forcing them off. Clean any remaining glue with nail file or remover, store in original packaging, and they're ready for reuse."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I file these nails to adjust the length?",
          "answer": "Yes! These almond nails can be filed or trimmed to your desired length for a customized fit. Use a fine-grit nail file to gently shape the tips and edges, ensuring smooth results."

        {
          "question": "Are red candy cane nails too bold for everyday wear?",
          "answer": "Not at all! While eye-catching, the classic red and white combination is actually workplace-appropriate and versatile. The festive nature makes them perfect for December, and the elegant almond shape keeps the look polished rather than playful."
        },
        {
          "question": "How realistic are the candy cane stripes on these nails?",
          "answer": "Very realistic! The white candy cane patterns are expertly printed and sealed with a glossy topcoat, creating convincing peppermint stripes. They look like professional salon nail art and maintain their definition throughout the entire wear period."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do red nails show every little imperfection?",
          "answer": "The glossy finish and bold red color do show fingerprints and dust more than lighter shades. We recommend using a microfiber cloth occasionally to maintain that pristine shine, which actually enhances the candy cane pattern visibility."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I remove and store these nails for reuse?",
          "answer": "Soak your nails in warm soapy water for 5-10 minutes to soften the adhesive, then gently lift the nails from the edges. Clean off residual glue, dry completely, and store in the original packaging in a cool, dry place for reuse 2-3 times."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can these red nails be worn with any outfit?",
          "answer": "Yes! Red and white are versatile holiday colors. They pair beautifully with green accents, gold jewelry, silver accessories, white garments, and any festive or neutral clothing. The classic combination works with virtually every holiday style."

      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What exactly is a coffin nail shape?",
          "answer": "Coffin nails (also called ballerina nails) feature a wider, rounded base that tapers toward the tips with a squared-off edge at the top. This elegant shape is elongating for fingers and provides a spacious canvas for artistic designs like these swirl gradients."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are the pink and white swirls hand-painted or printed?",
          "answer": "The swirl gradients are expertly applied and sealed under a protective glossy topcoat, creating a smooth, professional finish. The seamless blend between pink and white appears hand-painted while maintaining durability throughout the 7-14 day wear period."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do these abstract nails work for professional settings?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! The soft pink and white color palette is workplace-appropriate, and the abstract swirl design is sophisticated rather than playful. Perfect for creative industries or holiday office events celebrating the season with refined elegance."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I prevent the swirl design from fading?",
          "answer": "The designs are sealed under a high-quality glossy topcoat that resists fading. Avoid excessive water exposure in the first 24 hours to allow full adhesion, and the gradients will maintain their beauty throughout your entire wear period."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I file or customize the coffin shape?",
          "answer": "Yes! These nails can be filed to adjust the tip width or length. Use a fine-grit nail file for gentle shaping, though the coffin design works beautifully as-is for most preferences."
