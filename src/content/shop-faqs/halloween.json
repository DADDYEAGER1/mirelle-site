        "question": "When should I apply Halloween press-on nails?",
        "answer": "For Halloween festivities, apply your press-on nails 1-3 days before your main event. This ensures they look fresh and pristine for parties, trick-or-treating, or costume photos. Since our Halloween designs last up to 2 weeks, you can also apply them early October and enjoy spooky nails throughout the entire Halloween season. Many customers wear them from mid-October straight through to November 1st.",

        "question": "Are Halloween press-on nails too bold for everyday wear?",
        "answer": "Our Halloween collection ranges from subtle spooky to boldly festive. For everyday October wear, choose our minimalist ghost designs, matte black nails, or burnt orange shades that give autumn vibes without screaming \"costume.\" Save the 3D pumpkins, neon green spiderwebs, and blood splatter designs for actual Halloween events. We offer versatile options so you can embrace Halloween spirit at whatever intensity suits your style.",

        "question": "What's the most popular Halloween nail design?",
        "answer": "This year, minimalist spooky designs dominate Halloween nail trends. Think tiny ghost accents on nude bases, matte black with orange French tips, and simple spiderweb line art rather than elaborate 3D scenes. However, our classic jack-o'-lantern faces and purple-black ombre designs remain bestsellers for those who love traditional Halloween aesthetics. The 2025 trend leans toward \"spooky cute\" rather than genuinely scary.",

        "question": "Can kids wear Halloween press-on nails?",
        "answer": "While our Halloween press-ons are designed for adult hands, they can work for older children and teens when properly sized. Look for our smallest sizes and consider trimming them shorter for younger wearers. For children under 10, we recommend using adhesive tabs instead of nail glue for easier removal. Adult supervision during application is important. Always do a test fit before committing to ensure comfort and safety for younger Halloween enthusiasts.",

        "question": "Do Halloween press-on nails work with costumes?",
        "answer": "Halloween press-on nails are the perfect costume accessory! They complete your look without the commitment of a salon visit. Pair our blood-red nails with vampire costumes, black stiletto shapes with witch outfits, or green glitter designs with alien or monster characters. Since they're easy to apply and remove, you can even coordinate different nail designs with multiple costumes if you attend several Halloween events.",

        "question": "Will Halloween press-on nails survive trick-or-treating?",
        "answer": "Yes, when properly applied with nail glue, our Halloween press-ons easily survive trick-or-treating adventures. They won't pop off from holding candy bags, ringing doorbells, or nighttime walking. For maximum durability during active Halloween festivities, choose shorter nail lengths that won't catch on costume elements or candy wrappers. Apply them the morning of Halloween for the strongest bond throughout your spooky night.",

        "question": "Can I reuse Halloween press-on nails next year?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Halloween press-ons are one of the most reusable seasonal designs. After Halloween, carefully remove them using the soak method, clean off adhesive residue with non-acetone remover, and store them in their original packaging in a cool, dry place. Protected from sunlight and moisture, they'll remain perfect for next October. This makes them an economical choice - invest once and enjoy spooky nails every Halloween season.",
