        "question": "How do I know which trendy nail shape suits my hands?",
        "answer": "Choose nail shapes based on your natural nail bed and finger length. Short, wide fingers look best with almond or oval shapes that create elongation. Long, thin fingers can rock any shape including dramatic stiletto or coffin styles. For practical trendy nails, short squoval (square-oval) works universally and suits most current designs. Our collection includes shape variety, and you can always file down longer nails to customize your perfect trendy look.",

        "answer": "Trendy press-ons let you experiment with the latest styles without the 2+ hour salon commitment or $60-100+ cost per appointment. Since trends change quickly, press-ons allow you to try multiple looks throughout the year affordably. They're also reusable, so you can rotate between trending styles for different occasions. Plus, you get instant access to viral designs without waiting for your nail tech to learn new techniques. Change trends as often as fashion does!",
