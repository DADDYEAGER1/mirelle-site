        "question": "When should I apply New Year press-on nails?",
        "answer": "Apply your New Year press-on nails on December 30th or 31st for the freshest look on NYE. If you're attending multiple holiday parties leading up to New Year's, you can apply them as early as December 28th - our designs last 10-14 days, so they'll remain gorgeous through the first week of January. This timing ensures your nails look pristine for midnight toasts and all your New Year's celebration photos.",

        "question": "What makes New Year nails different from regular glitter nails?",
        "answer": "New Year press-on nails feature specific celebratory elements beyond standard glitter. Think champagne-inspired gold sparkle, midnight-themed dark bases with shimmer, confetti designs, and metallic accents that capture party vibes. While regular glitter nails are pretty, New Year designs specifically evoke that countdown-to-midnight excitement with luxe finishes, often combining multiple metallic tones and special effects like holographic shine or crushed glass textures.",

        "question": "Will New Year glitter press-ons shed glitter everywhere?",
        "answer": "Our New Year press-on nails feature sealed glitter that won't shed or flake off during your celebrations. The glitter is embedded within gel layers and topped with a protective clear coat, not sprinkled on top. You can toast champagne, dance, hug friends at midnight, and take countless photos without leaving a glitter trail. This professional sealing technique ensures your nails stay beautiful without the mess of loose glitter.",

        "question": "Can I wear New Year nails to work in January?",
        "answer": "Many of our New Year designs transition beautifully into January professional settings. Opt for our sophisticated gold chrome, subtle champagne shimmer, or elegant rose gold options rather than obvious party designs with confetti. These refined metallics look polished and celebratory without appearing costume-like for office environments. Save the bold purple-pink party nails with obvious New Year motifs for actual NYE celebrations and weekend gatherings.",

        "question": "Do New Year press-on nails photograph well?",
        "answer": "New Year press-ons are specifically designed to be photo-ready! The metallic and glitter finishes catch light beautifully in party photos, selfies, and professional event photography. Gold, silver, and holographic elements create dimension and sparkle on camera without looking flat. For the best photos, choose designs with some contrast - like dark bases with gold accents - which pop more in pictures than single-tone metallics.",

        "question": "What New Year nail length is best for dancing and celebrating?",
        "answer": "For active New Year's Eve celebrations with dancing, toasting, and midnight hugs, we recommend short to medium length nails (under 20mm). These lengths provide glamorous sparkle while remaining practical for holding champagne glasses, dancing comfortably, and celebrating without worrying about nail breakage. Our short almond and medium squoval shapes in metallic finishes offer the perfect balance of party-ready style and functional durability.",

        "question": "Can I transition New Year nails into Valentine's Day?",
        "answer": "Several of our New Year designs work beautifully into Valentine's season! Rose gold, pink champagne shimmer, and purple-toned metallics transition seamlessly from NYE parties to February romance. If your New Year nails are still in great condition mid-January, keep wearing them through Valentine's Day. The glitter and luxe finishes complement both occasions. For customers who love continuous seasonal style, this overlap provides excellent value from one press-on set.",
