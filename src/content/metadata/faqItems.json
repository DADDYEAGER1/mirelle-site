    {
      "question": "What is the best nail shape for vampire nails",
      "answer": "Stiletto and coffin shapes work best for vampire nails because they mimic fang-like points and provide ample space for gothic art. If you prefer shorter nails, almond or oval shapes still capture the vampire aesthetic beautifully without the extreme length."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I do vampire nails on short nails",
      "answer": "Short vampire nails look stunning with almond or oval shapes. Focus on bold colors like blood red or black, add small fang accents or rhinestones, and keep designs simple. Short nails actually make daily tasks easier while still embracing the vampire vibe."
    },
    {
      "question": "What colors are best for vampire nails",
      "answer": "Blood red, midnight black, and dark purple are the top vampire nail colors. Crimson adds drama, while silver or gold metallic accents bring gothic glamour. Mixing matte black bases with glossy red drips creates that fresh-from-the-crypt look."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I create a dripping blood effect",
      "answer": "Use a thin brush dipped in blood red polish to draw drip shapes from your cuticle down. Let gravity guide you - real blood drips are imperfect with irregular lengths. Seal with glossy top coat for a wet blood look that photographs beautifully."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are vampire nails only for Halloween",
      "answer": "Vampire nails are a year-round gothic aesthetic. Many people rock blood red stilettos in summer and coffin nails for Valentines Day. The key is adjusting the intensity - go full spooky for October or elegant dark glam any other month."

    {
      "question": "What products do I need for vampire nails at home",
      "answer": "You need quality gel or regular polish in red and black, base and top coats, a thin nail art brush, and optional embellishments like rhinestones or 3D bat charms. Cuticle oil and nail prep dehydrator are essential for longevity."

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I add glitter to vampire nails",

    },
    {
      "question": "What nail length is best for vampire nail designs",
      "answer": "Medium to long nails provide the best canvas for intricate vampire designs, but short nails work beautifully too. If going for stiletto or coffin shapes, aim for at least medium length. Short nails should focus on bold colors and minimal detailed art."

    {
      "question": "How do I remove vampire nail embellishments safely",
      "answer": "Soak a cotton pad in acetone, place it on the nail, wrap with foil, and wait 10-15 minutes. Gently push off softened gel and embellishments with an orangewood stick. Never peel or force them off as that damages your natural nail plate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between vampire nails and gothic nails",
      "answer": "Vampire nails specifically reference blood, fangs, and vampire lore with reds and blacks. Gothic nails are broader, including lace, crosses, dark purples, and Victorian elements. Think of vampire nails as a subset of gothic nail art styles."
