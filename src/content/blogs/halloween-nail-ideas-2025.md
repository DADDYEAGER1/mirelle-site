## Tips for Long-Lasting Halloween Nails

**Choose Gel or Dip**: Lasts 2-3 weeks without chipping for multi-day festivities.

**Prep Is Everything**: Clean, buffed nails with quality base coat prevent staining from dark polishes.

**Thin Coats Win**: Multiple thin coats dry faster and last longer than one thick coat.

**Seal Those Tips**: Wrap tips with topcoat by swiping over nail edge to prevent peeling.

**Cuticle Oil Daily**: Keeps nails hydrated. Dry cuticles cause polish to lift.
